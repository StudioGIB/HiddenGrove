<p align="center">an early concept focused on lowering the visual impact of the cabin </p>


# About HiddenGrove 
HiddenGrove is a tiny house dedicated to reading and resting. The client asked me to design and build a small cabin where he could hide away from the and spend few hours reading and playing music. This project is set to be build in a little grove of bushes and olive trees, in the southern part of Italy; as such all the materials and the technical choices will be defined according to a temperate-dry weather. This is definitely not a mountain cabin.

Brief
Use :
1) Small indoor space, size will be around (3x3)m (2.5mx 2.5m), with a modest decking platform on the outside. The design will include integrated furniture in order to accomodate the client's requests: a space for reading, resting and play music 

2) The cabin should be mimetic and integrated in the context as much as possible. 

4) Possibly a light foundation or no foundation system will be employed, soil permeability has to be taken into account

5) Due attention will be focused on natural ventilation systems and proper insulation and/or intentional thermal dispersion for the hot day summer conditions.

Windows/transparent partitions:
1) Transparent partitions will be obviously tailored toward external view; when empty, shutters or blinds will allow the transparency not to be seen

Energy :
1) Small solar energy panels; the cabin will be most likely be outfitted with a camping size battery, enabling to power some lights and a small electrical heater.


Cost
The objective is to keep construction costs around a 10.000 / 20.000 â‚¬ budget

Materials and techniques:

1) Cost, performance and origin of the materials will be taken highly in account. In order to stay in a 15/20k price cap we'll need to optimize the geometries and the tech used in order to protect the elements from the weather wear. Standardization of the joints/frames is another goal. Ideally we'd like to "assemble" as many completed pieces on site as possible. Transparent partitions will be an issue, since glass will be too expensive to be employed and Polycarbonate sheets performance are not stellar concerning temperature transmission and weathering. Lightness of the raw materials will be highly taken into account, considering the ease of transport by hand or light carrier. 
We'll try to source all the materials locally.


# Open Source Design - Fabrication 
We work on experimental design fueled by public support.
We strongly believe in a new way of doing Architecture, one in which we share with you the process and the results of our research, designs and builds.
All of GIB's projects are open-source. That is, during the development of any one project, all the content is hosted publicly on Github. We are also available via chat rooms on [Discord](https://discord.gg/3Qf9EzJqV9).

As we're mostly self-sustained, in order to keep our research free and running, we're on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/StudioGIB) too, where you can support us with your contribute.

# Ethos
The idea behind open sourced Architecture is that anyone could take the "recipe" and build it locally.
It cutting down the costs of transport, packaging and delivery, reducing considerably the carbon footprint of the process.
In addition to ecological reasons, to build locally means redirecting work toward local craftsmans, thus an healtier economy.
